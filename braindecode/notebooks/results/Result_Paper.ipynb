    "First, small explanation: Originally, the bci competition was evaluated samplewise (kappa score). In the paper we compare to (http://www.eurasip.org/Proceedings/Eusipco/Eusipco2015/papers/1570104275.pdf), they evaluate trialwise. However they only use a 0.5-2.5sec window of the 4sec trial, beacuse the winner of the original competition used this window. I think this actually decreases accuracy on the trialbased evaluation and of course limits data available to train on. So first I validated our CSP implementation with the 0.5-2.5 sec window and then proceeded with the full window (or 0.5-4sec for CSP).\n",
